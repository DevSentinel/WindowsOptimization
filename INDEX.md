## Recommended Guide

My Personal Favorite guide for Windows Machine Optimization to this day would be XanderBaatz's -  [Comprehensive Guide | "How to Optimize Windows 10 for Gaming and Productivity".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJTCwSX9Ym8&t) In the 40 minute video, there are 5 different sequences. The sequences are: Prerequisites, Settings, Control Panel, Debloat & Stabilize, and last but not least - Finalization.  An excellent comprehensive guide with step by step instructions to tweaking the windows OS for better performance.

## Calypto's Guide

Another one of my Personal Favorite Windows OS Optimization guides have to be [Calypto’s Latency Guide](https://calypto.us). Aimed for Smoother, more responsive gameplay and input. In the Google Document, there is provided research and benchmarks for you to have a better understanding on optimizations. I PERSONALLY use this guide to most.
